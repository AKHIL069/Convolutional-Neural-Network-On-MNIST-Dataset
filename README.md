# Convolutional-Neural-Network-On-MNIST-Dataset
We trained a multilayer perception (MLP) to classify handwritten digit images in MNIST dataset with 10 different labels from 0 to 9.  Our neural network has three hidden layers, each followed by a ReLU nonlinearity which has non-saturing property, and a final 10-way softmax.
